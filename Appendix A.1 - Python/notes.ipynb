    "# Appendix A.1 - Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language, that supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python has a somewhat [Zen description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python) of its design principles, which you can find inside the Python interpreter itself by typing **import this**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most discussed of these is: **there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.** Code written in accordance with this “obvious” way (which may not be obvious at all to a newcomer) is often described as **“Pythonic.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't already have Python, I strongly recommend you install the [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) version, which includes many of the libraries needed for data science. Get the Python 3 version, not the Python 2 version. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every data science project will require some combination of external libraries, sometimes with specific versions that differ from the versions used for other projects. With a single Python installation, these libraries would conflict and cause all sorts of problems. The standard solution is to use **virtual environments**, which are sandboxed Python environments that maintain their own versions of Python libraries (and, depending on how you set up the environment, of Python itself). To create an (Anaconda) virtual environment, you just do the following 'conda create -n dsfs python=3.6'. As a matter of good discipline, you should always work in a virtual environment, and never using the “base” Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Anaconda, you can also download the [**JupyterLab**](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) which is a web-based interactive development environment for [**Jupyter notebooks**](https://jupyter.org/): an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text (just this one!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also use the [Google online Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb?hl=en) tool to write and execute Python in the browser, with zero configuration required, free access to Google GPUs and easy sharing."
